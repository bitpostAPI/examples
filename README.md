# Example API integrations

## Goal

With bitpost API you can get the transaction fee of your bitcoin on-chain transaction adjusted automatically. This will result in a cheaper transaction and more control over the date/time of confirmation. This fee adjustment is done without taking custody of your funds or doing any KYC. It is made possible by relaying a set of pre-signed transactions that signal for RBF. This principle is very general and can also be applied to lightning channel opening/closing transactions and peg-in/peg-out transactions to/from sidechains. This repository provides example integrations of the API, for the full guides/tutorials check our [documentation page](https://docs.bitpost.co).
